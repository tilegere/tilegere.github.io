            <h3>Now, since I am still working on learning web development, I don't have much to show so far.</h3>
            <h3>And since I do so love learning, I am primarily working on the tutorials so I can create great things.</h3>
            <h3>With that said, I do need to start putting some of what I learn into practice, and that means working on a site.</h3>
            <h3>And I think the portfolio is a great place to start so I can showcase things as I make them!</h3>
            <h3>Also, git practice.</h3>
            <h3>But for now, I need to get into the habit of not only learning things on a regular basis, but producing things as well.</h3>
            <h3>So even though this page might not look like much at the beginning, it will nurture a habit of creation alongside my habit of learning.</h3>
            <h3>Thank you for reading and I hope to see you again once my page looks better!</h3>
            <h3>First project (work in progress): <a href="https://tilegere.github.io/mastermind">Mastermind!</a></h3>
