            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>My name is Tina Légère, and I have always been interested in technology.  I started out by becoming a computer tech in the early 2000's, but was always drawn to programming.  I picked up HTML/Javascript to make games for the web and found that I enjoyed building things.  I've since continued working with various frameworks and libraries, enjoying every step of the way.</p>

            <h3>And since I do so love learning, I am primarily working on the tutorials so I can create great things.</h3>
            <h3>With that said, I do need to start putting some of what I learn into practice, and that means working on a site.</h3>
            <h3>And I think the portfolio is a great place to start so I can showcase things as I make them!</h3>
            <h3>Also, git practice.</h3>
            <h3>But for now, I need to get into the habit of not only learning things on a regular basis, but producing things as well.</h3>
            <h3>So even though this page might not look like much at the beginning, it will nurture a habit of creation alongside my habit of learning.</h3>
            <h3>Thank you for reading and I hope to see you again once my page looks better!</h3> -->
